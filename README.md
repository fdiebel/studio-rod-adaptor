Designed with [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/).

Instructions
--------

I printed with PLA filament on the following settings, and results were okay.

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 2.05
* Fill: 50

There was a *very* slight bit of flex with my follow focus mounted but not enough to affect pulling focus.

To finish the project, you will need 2 M4 nuts and 2 ~20mm M4 bolts, preferrably with wing nuts for easy hand-tightening.
