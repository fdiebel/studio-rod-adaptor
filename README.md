Lightweight to Studio Rod Adaptor
=============

Allows for mounting lightweight accessories made for 15mm rods w/ 60mm spacing on studio hardware that uses 15m rods at 100mm spacing. Perfect for light accessories, such as a follow focus.

There may be some issues with clearance or fit depending on what you're trying to mount to this; I designed it to fit with the fear that I have. Feel free to modify the source files if needed

Designed with [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/).

Instructions
--------

I printed with PLA filament on the following settings, and results were okay.

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 2.05
* Fill: 50

There was a *very* slight bit of flex with my follow focus mounted but not enough to affect pulling focus. I'll probably try printing with different settings/materials and see if that makes any difference.

The 15mm mounts on the lower support will likely be a slightly tight fit on your support rods; sand the inner wall if needed.

To finish the project, you will need 2 M4 nuts and 2 ~20mm M4 bolts, preferrably with wing nuts for easy hand-tightening.
