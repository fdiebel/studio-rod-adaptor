=============

Instructions
--------
I printed with HIPS filament on the following settings, and results were great

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 1.05
* Fill: 20

I suppose if you're concerned about the aesthetics you could use 0.1 layers but to my eye it really wasn't enough a difference to justify the print time.
